    An entire one-and-a-half year Shire calendar covering the War of the Ring
    features a clickable link

    starting on the day Gandalf visited Hobbiton
    to reveal to Frodo the identity of the Ring
    and ending with the Battle of Bywater in the Shire.

    How can every month of the Hobbit calendar have 30 days,
    when the number of days in a year isn’t a multiple of 30?
    This guide to the Hobbit calendar
    draws on material from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>
    especially its appendices.

    <a href="/moon.html">Phases of the Moon</a> —
    An extended treatise on why Moon phases in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>
    are impossible to reconcile with the Moon’s schedule:
    because Tolkien tried to use the Moon phases from a modern calendar,
    but was unaware of the difference
    between the common use of the phrase “New Moon”
    versus what a calendar or almanac means by it.
    This made it difficult to display a little Moon icon with the correct phase
    next to each date in the Shire Calendar,
    but with an artificial adjustment the Moon was forced to match the text.
