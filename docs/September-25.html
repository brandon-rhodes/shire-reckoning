<h1 id="september-25-s.r.-1418-t.a.-3018">September 25, S.R. 1418 (T.A. 3018)</h1>
<p>This date is not mentioned in the <em>Tale of Years</em>,
but its events are easy to chronicle
thanks to the fact that they follow immediately
upon those of September 24th
in the chapter ‘Three is Company’
and are concluded in the next chapter ‘A Short Cut to Mushrooms’.</p>
