Strider leads the Hobbits east
through the Chetwood north of the Road.

</p><p>
Gandalf leaves Bree before dawn upon Shadowfax,
riding east in pursuit of the five Riders
who passed through during the night.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/15.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 21.1% full">&nbsp;<a id="d2"><b>October 2.</b></a> <p>
Strider and the Hobbits travelling east come out of the Chetwood
and enter the Midgewater marshes.
While walking during the day they are tormented by flies and midges,
and their sleep in camp is distrubed by the drone of loud insects.

</p><p>
Gandalf continues riding east from Bree in pursuit of the Black Riders.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/17.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 24.1% full">&nbsp;<a id="d3"><b>October 3.</b></a> <p>
Another day of travel through the Midge-water Marshes
brings Strider and the four Hobbits to another uncomfortable
and insect-tormented night of camping

</p><p>
Gandalf reaches the summit of Weathertop in the afternoon;
the Nine Riders withdraw until sunset,
then attack the wizard amidst the foundations of the ancient watch-tower.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/19.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 27.4% full">&nbsp;<a id="d4"><b>October 4.</b></a> <p>
The land across which Strider and the Hobbits travel begins to rise,
leaving behind the Midge-water Marshes
and raising the Weather Hills into sight to the east.
They are again approaching the Road,
which had turned south in a wide loop to avoid the marshes.
For the first time they set a watch overnight,
in addition to Strider's usual watchfulness.

</p><p>
From their camp in the Midge-water Marshes,
Strider and Frodo see flashes of lightning to the east:
distant beacons of the battle Gandalf wages on Weathertop
against all nine of the Nazgûl.
The wizard survives the night and flees to the northeast,
successfully drawing four Riders after him and away from the road.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/22.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 30.9% full">&nbsp;<a id="d5"><b>October 5.</b></a> <p>
Morning frost and pale blue sky refresh the four Hobbits,
who with Strider begin another day of travel
that brings them to the feet of the Weather hills where they camp.

</p><p>
Another day of Gandalf's fourteen-day trek from Weathertop to Rivendell,
by way of the Ettenmoors one hundred miles to the north.
Once the four Riders break off their pursuit a few days into the journey,
Shadowfax departs for Rohan
since he cannot assist Gandalf in the rocky troll-fells.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/24.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 34.3% full">&nbsp;<a id="d6"><b>October 6.</b></a> <p>
Strider leads the Hobbits south
along the old fort-path that hugs the west side of the Weather Hills.
From the summit of Weathertop,
Frodo and Merry for the first time see the Misty Mountains.
Strider finds a <i>G</i>-rune left by Gandalf,
and correctly deduces
that the flashes he and Frodo saw in the eastern sky three nights ago
were a battle atop this hill between the wizard and the Nine Riders.
They see five Riders on the road below them,
which attack them at night in a dell north of the summit.
During the attack Frodo succumbs to the temptation to wear the Ring,
which while hiding him from mortal eyes
makes him visible to the Ring-wraiths
in whose minds the living are otherwise vague shadows.
The Witch-lord charges him and stabs his shoulder with a Morgul-knife
whose tip will remain in the wound,
working its way inward.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/27.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 37.6% full">&nbsp;<a id="d7"><b>October 7.</b></a> <p>
Following the attack upon the party last night
in which the Lord of the Nazgûl wounded Frodo,
Strider leads the Hobbits into the empty lands south of the Road
through which they continue to press east toward Rivendell.
Though they hear the distant cry and answer of two Nazgûl
as they pass across the Road itself,
there is no further indication that they are being pursued;
they hope to again escape ambush by avoiding the East-West Road,
and they thread amongst the shelter
of thickets and small stands of trees &mdash;
and at night they light a campfire both to discourage another attack
and to keep Frodo warm.
Though he hides the fact from his friends,
the pain in his shoulder starts growing by the end of the day.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/31.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 44.2% full">&nbsp;<a id="d9"><b>October 9.</b></a> <p>
The news has reached Elrond from the wandering company of Gildor
that Frodo the Hobbit is moving east from the Shire
and is carrying some great burden, without the guidance of Gandalf.
Elrond dispatches those of his household able to contest the Nine;
the Elf-lord Glorfindel is sent west along the great road.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/36.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 50.5% full">&nbsp;<a id="d11"><b>October 11.</b></a> <p>
The Elven-lord Glorfindel reaches the bridge over the river Mitheithel
after two days of travel along the road from Rivendell,
and finds it guarded by three Nazgûl.
While this suggests that the Ringbearer has not yet been captured,
it also indicates that he has probably not yet reached the Bridge.
As Glorfindel approaches, the three guards flee westward;
before pursuing them he leaves a beryl to mark his passage.

</p><p>
Five days after leaving Weathertop and passing south of the road,
Strider leads the Hobbits out of the shallow valley
through which they have been travelling east,
and they angle towards the north to return to the Road,
on which they will reach the river Mitheithel and cross upon the Last Bridge.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/38.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 53.9% full">&nbsp;<a id="d12"><b>October 12.</b></a> <p>
On the sixth day since Strider lead the Hobbits from Weathertop,
they reach the top of a slope from which they command a wide view
of the lands around them.
The East-West Road is visible to their north,
to which they will now return so that they can use the Last Bridge
to cross the river Mitheithel &mdash; which is also visible, to the east.
Many miles to the south they can see both the Hoarwell and the Loudwater.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/41.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 57.3% full">&nbsp;<a id="d13"><b>October 13.</b></a> <p>
In the morning Strider leads the Hobbits back to the East-West Road,
which they abandoned seven days ago
in order to travel through the wilds to its south
and so avoid the searches of the Nazgûl.
They reach the Last Bridge,
across which the Road crosses the river Mitheithel,
and find the beryl-stone which Glorfindel left two days ago
when he drove off the three Riders guarding the bridge.
Correctly interpreting this as meaning that crossing the bridge is safe,
Strider leads the Hobbits across,
then they again abandon the road,
turning north into Troll-fells.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/43.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 60.6% full">&nbsp;<a id="d14"><b>October 14.</b></a> <p>
Strider leads the Hobbits for a second day
amongst the valleys and ridges of Troll-fells north of the Road
as they travel farther from the river Mitheithel
and toward the Bruinen,
on the far side of which lies Rivendell.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/46.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 63.9% full">&nbsp;<a id="d15"><b>October 15.</b></a> <p>
On their third day of clambering among the Troll-fells,
rains begins to pour upon Strider and the Hobbits.
For probably the first evening since leaving Bree more than two weeks ago,
they are unable to even light a fire for warmth
despite the fact that Frodo's wound continues to worsen.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/48.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 67.2% full">&nbsp;<a id="d16"><b>October 16.</b></a> <p>
As the hills rise higher in front of them,
Strider and the Hobbits
must turn farther northwards into the Troll-fells &mdash;
detouring away from both the Road to the south
and the river Bruinen which they are trying to reach to their east.
The wound that Frodo received on Weathertop ten days ago
for the first time tonight prevents him from sleeping because of the pain.

</p><p>
The Elf-lord Glorfindel,
who since crossing the Last Bridge five days ago
has been searching for the Hobbits back west of the river Mitheithel,
finds their trail which leads him back east across the Bridge
and toward Rivendell.
He sees their trail turn north into the Troll-fells,
but travels straight east along the road
hoping to encounter them when they return to it.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/50.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 70.6% full">&nbsp;<a id="d17"><b>October 17.</b></a> <p>
The rain clears that has been soaking Strider and the Hobbits,
and they are able to turn south again toward the Road
and they camp atop a ridge.
Frodo is becoming very weak,
which is making progress through the fells very difficult.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/53.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 73.9% full">&nbsp;<a id="d18"><b>October 18.</b></a> <p>
Strider and the Hobbits leave their camp on the ridge in the Troll-fells,
enjoying the clear morning after more than two days of steady rain.
Frodo is succumbing to the wound of the Morgul-knife
he received twelve days ago;
a mist occasionally obscures his sight
as his perception of the lighted world begins to dim.
Winding downhill to the south,
back toward the Road,
they discover the trolls &mdash;
long since turned to stone &mdash;
that Bilbo encountered on his own journey east seventy-seven years ago.
Late in the evening they reach the Road,
and meet the Elf-lord Glorfindel.
After attending to Frodo's wound,
Glorfindel leads them in a night march eastward along the road.

</p><p>
After a journey of fourteen days from Weathertop,
Gandalf reaches the safety of Imladris.
He assists Elrond in preparing a flood of the river Bruinen
should the Riders attempt to cross the Ford.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/55.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 77.4% full">&nbsp;<a id="d19"><b>October 19.</b></a> <p>
After walking all night,
Glorfindel and Strider halt at dawn
and allow the Hobbits five hours of sleep.
Through the day they accomplish three further long marches,
covering almost twenty miles,
and reach a point where the road bends right and turns into valley.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/58.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 81.0% full">&nbsp;<a id="d20"><b>October 20.</b></a> <p>
Early in the morning Glorfindel and Strider wake the Hobbits
and set out on a final march east
along the Road toward the Fords of Bruinen.
As they reach its floodplain,
they are overtaken from behind by five mounted Nazgûl,
and then four more emerge from ambush
as the white horse of Glorfindel carries Frodo toward the Ford.
They make it across the Ford;
the Lord of the Nazgûl begins to cross after them;
and then all Nine are swept away
as Elrond and Gandalf release the flood they have been preparing,
and Glorfindel and Strider attack from behind
and panic the horses of those who remain on the west bank.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/69.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 96.2% full">&nbsp;<a id="d24"><b>October 24.</b></a> <p>
Boromir, in the late evening of his hundred and eleventh day of travel,
reaches Imladris, the valley of Rivendell, of which he knew only legend,
and begins to search for the house of Elrond.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/0.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 0.3% full">&nbsp;<a id="d25"><b>October 25.</b></a> <p>
In the early hours Boromir,
who yesterday entered the valley of Rivendell itself
after more than a hundred days of travel from his home in Minas Tirith,
finally reaches the house of Elrond.

</p><p>
With Frodo safe in Rivendell and having regained consciousness yesterday,
the Council of Elrond is now called,
and decides to attempt the destruction of the Ring
in the heat of the mountain in which it was forged.

</p><p>
Through the afternoon following the Council of Elrond,
scouts begin leaving Rivendell
to determine whether the Nine Riders still linger west of the Mountains.
Aragorn leaves with the sons of Elrond,
who will head southeast across the Misty Mountains and down the Silverlode
while Aragorn himself goes West and hunts with his Rangers.

</p><p><img src="/images/phases/3.png" height=24 width=24 alt="moon 4.6% full">&nbsp;<a id="d26"><b>October 26.</b></a> <p>
With Frodo recovered and the Council of Elrond complete,
the Hobbits find themselves free to enjoy
the feasts and songs and autumn starlight of Rivendell,
and the company of their old friend Bilbo.
While Sam has already been given permission
to accompany his master on his quest,
Elrond has not yet decreed
whether Merry and Pippin will be allowed to accompany them.
<p>
Gandalf and Elrond continue to consult with one another
about arrangements for the impending quest.
Among the other guests of Elrond
who remain at Rivendell through the close of autumn
are Boromir of Gondor, the wood-elf Legolas,
and Gimli, son of the dwarf Glóin
with whom Bilbo adventured seventy-seven years ago.
