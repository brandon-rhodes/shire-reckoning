<h1 id="december-130-s.r.-1418-t.a.-3018">December 1–30, S.R. 1418 (T.A. 3018)</h1>
<p>As the days grow shorter
and the nights grow longer
and winter looms down upon Middle-Earth,
<em>The Lord of the Rings</em> offers quietly urgent descriptions
of the preparations underway in the warmth and light of Rivendell.
Scouts return with their reports.
Aragorn and Gandalf spend hours planning for the journey ahead.
A single black cloak is discovered
downstream of the Ford of Bruinen.</p>
<p>And none of it, alas, is accompanied by a single date.</p>
<p>There is a vague reference to ‘mid-December’,
which I suppose we can place on a similarly vague mid-December date.</p>
<div class="tweet">
<b>The Shire-Reckoning</b> · <span>Dec 11 · 2:28 <span class="am-pm">pm</span></span>
<p>
In mid-December the scouts start returning to Rivendell, having found no trace of the Nazgûl. Elrond begins planning the Ring’s departure.
</p>
</div>
<p>But the <em>Tale of Years</em> itself is silent for the entire two months
between October 25 and December 25.
Between those dates,
the text only allows us to date a single event:
Elrond finishes the debate
about who will accompany Frodo
with the words,
‘In seven days the Company must depart,’
so he must be speaking on December 18.</p>
<div class="tweet">
<b>The Shire-Reckoning</b> · <span>Dec 18 · 5:00 <span class="am-pm">pm</span></span>
<p>
Elrond names the Company of the Ring, from all the Free Peoples:<br><br>Hobbits—Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin<br>(the latter over Elrond’s objection).<br>Men—Aragorn and Boromir.<br>Elves—Legolas.<br>Dwarves—Gimli.<br><br>And Gandalf—‘for this shall be his great task and maybe the end of his labours.’
</p>
</div>
<p>One might have thought that Elrond’s Elven-smiths wouldn’t wait
until a bare week before Aragorn’s departure
to reforge his sword,
but during that same discussion
Aragorn uses the future tense when he tells Frodo that
‘the Sword-that-was-Broken shall be reforged ere I set out to war’—so it must be between the 18th and the 25th
that the shards of the ancient sword
are reworked in the glowing forges of Rivendell.</p>
<p>But, as with most of the other preparations,
we are not given a specific date.</p>
<p>Thus,
no further events can be securely dated
until ‘the morning of the last day’
when Frodo makes a final visit
to his old friend Bilbo in the hobbit’s small room on the ground floor.</p>
<div class="tweet">
<b>The Shire-Reckoning</b> · <span>Dec 25 · 9:00 <span class="am-pm">am</span></span>
<p>
Today the Company will depart. Bilbo gives Frodo his sword Sting and—secretly—his magnificent Dwarvish mail-coat of pure mithril. The old hobbit sings softly.<br><br>‘I sit beside the fire and think<br>of how the world will be<br>when winter comes without a spring<br>that I shall ever see…’
</p>
</div>

<p>
The Company of the Ring (with their baggage on Bill the pony) gathers on Rivendell’s threshold at dusk. Boromir sounds his horn. Sam remembers that he hasn’t packed rope. And Elrond gives his blessing: ‘May the stars shine upon your faces!’<br><br>They walk south into the Wild.
</p>
</div>
<p>‘Then with one
glance at the Last Homely House twinkling below them they strode away
far into the night.’</p>
<p>No chronology is offered of the days that follow.
‘The first part of their journey was hard
and dreary, and Frodo remembered little of it, save the wind.’
Two weeks of travel are summarized
in three paragraphs that describe the Company’s daily schedule,
their order of march,
and how the mountains loom higher as they move south.</p>
<div class="tweet">
<b>The Shire-Reckoning</b> · <span>Dec 26 · 8:30 <span class="am-pm">am</span></span>
<p>
As the morning grows bright, the Company of the Ring stop walking and conceal themselves as best they can. They try to sleep. Thus begins the routine of their winter march: sleep during the day; supper in late afternoon; and an overnight walk south through bitter winter wind.
</p>
</div>
<p>For how many days do they march south
without an event that we might mark on our calendar?
It’s the next paragraph that finally offers us an anchor:
‘They had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed.’
The next dateable event will fall in January.</p>
