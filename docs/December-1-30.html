<p>As the days in Middle-Earth grow shorter
and the autumn nights grow longer,
<em>The Lord of the Rings</em> offers quietly urgent descriptions
of the preparations underway in the warmth and light of Rivendell.
Aragorn and Gandalf consult Rivendell’s trove of maps
as they debate the journey ahead.
Eagles of the mountains are asked for news.
And scouts are sent out to search the surrounding lands.
Later in the autumn, they start to return.</p>
<p>But none of this activity, alas, is accompanied by a single specific date.</p>
<p>There is a vague reference to ‘mid-December’,
which I suppose we can place on a similarly vague mid-December date.</p>

<p>
In mid-December the scouts start returning to Rivendell, having found no trace of the Nazgûl. Elrond begins planning the Ring’s departure.
</p>
</div>
<p>The <em>Tale of Years</em> is silent for the entire two months
between October 25 and December 25.
But the narrative itself does securely date one event:
the naming of the Company of the Ring.
Elrond finishes that discussion with the words,
‘In seven days the Company must depart,’
so he must be speaking on December 18.</p>
<div class="tweet">

<p>
Elrond names the Company of the Ring, from all the Free Peoples:<br><br>Hobbits—Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin.<br>Men—Aragorn and Boromir.<br>Elves—Legolas.<br>Dwarves—Gimli.<br><br>And, one wizard—Gandalf the Grey shall lead them, ‘for this shall be his great task and maybe the end of his labours.’
</p>
</div>
<p>We do know that Aragorn’s sword is re-forged
sometime during that final week in Rivendell.
Aragorn describes the sword’s re-forging in the future tense
when Elrond appoints the Fellowship on the 18th —
‘the Sword-that-was-Broken shall be reforged ere I set out to war’ —
and is carrying the completed sword when the Fellowship sets out on the 25th.
But we don’t know the specific date on which it was finished
and received its new name <em>Andúril</em>.</p>
<p>Thus,
no further events can be securely dated
until ‘the morning of the last day’
when Frodo makes a final visit
to his old friend Bilbo in the hobbit’s small room on the ground floor.</p>
<div class="tweet">

<p>
Today the Company will depart. Bilbo gives Frodo his sword Sting and—secretly—his magnificent Dwarvish mail-coat of pure mithril. The old hobbit sings softly.<br><br>‘I sit beside the fire and think<br>of how the world will be<br>when winter comes without a spring<br>that I shall ever see…’
</p>
</div>
<p>The Company depart as
‘the cheerless shadows of the early evening began to fall’
which, at the latitude of Rivendell,
will be just after four o’clock.</p>
<div class="tweet">

<p>
The Company of the Ring gathers on Rivendell’s threshold at dusk, with their baggage loaded on Bill the pony. Sam remembers that he hasn’t packed rope. Boromir sounds his horn. And Elrond gives his blessing: ‘May the stars shine upon your faces!’<br><br>They walk south into the Wild.
</p>
</div>
<p>‘Then with one
glance at the Last Homely House twinkling below them they strode away
far into the night.’</p>
<p>No chronology is offered of the days that follow.
‘The first part of their journey was hard
and dreary, and Frodo remembered little of it, save the wind.’
A full two weeks of travel are summarized
in three paragraphs that describe the Company’s daily schedule,
their order of march,
and how the mountains loom higher as they move south.
All we can do is offer a similiar summary.</p>
<div class="tweet">
<b>The Shire-Reckoning</b> · <span>Dec 26 · 8:30 <span class="am-pm">am</span></span>
<p>
As the morning grows bright, the Company of the Ring stop walking and conceal themselves as best they can. They try to sleep. Thus begins the routine of their winter march: sleep during the day; supper in late afternoon; and an overnight walk south through bitter winter wind.
</p>
</div>
<p>For how many days do they march south
without any specific dates that we might mark on a calendar?
It’s the next paragraph that finally offers us an anchor:
‘They had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed.’
So the next dateable event will fall in January.</p>
