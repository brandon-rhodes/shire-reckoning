<h1 id="september-22-s.r.-1418-t.a.-3018">September 22, S.R. 1418 (T.A. 3018)</h1>
<p>Here we reach one of the most famous dates in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>—Bilbo’s and Frodo’s
shared birthday, whose date is mentioned twice in the first chapter
‘A Long-expected Party’.
The birthday events of the main narrative
are supplemented by the <em>Tale of Years</em>,
which mentions two more:
Gandalf overtakes Shadowfax,
and the Nazgûl reach Sarn Ford.</p>

The day dawns bright for Frodo’s 50th birthday. The only furniture remaining at Bag End are the pieces that Frodo is selling tomorrow, with the hole itself, to the Sackville-Bagginses.

The sun is still in the sky as all nine Nazgûl reach the Shire’s southern border, ready to start their search for ‘Baggins’—but they are stopped. Rangers of the North, placed on guard by Aragorn, make a last stand to prevent them from crossing Sarn Ford.

Frodo celebrates his 50th birthday, and his last night at Bag End, with a dinner for the young hobbits who have been helping him move: Fredegar Bolger, Folco Boffin, Pippin Took, and Merry Brandybuck.<br><br>But there’s no sign of Gandalf. For the first time, the Grey Wizard is late.

As the night reaches its deepest dark, the nine Nazgûl overcome the Rangers defending Sarn Ford. Some flee into the wild. A few try to bear tidings to Aragorn, who is watching the road west of Bree. The rest are slain.
