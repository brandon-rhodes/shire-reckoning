<p>The <em>Tale of Years</em> for this date says only that ‘Gandalf crosses the Isen.’
The rest of the day’s events must be collected from the main narrative of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>
in the chapter ‘Three is Company’.</p>

Frodo wakes up, sore from sleeping against tree-roots. ‘And all my beautiful feather beds are sold to the Sackville-Bagginses! These tree-roots would do them good.’<br><br>Sam and Pippin light the morning’s fire and soon all three are enjoying their first breakfast on the road.

Their Hobbit breakfast has gone rather long, so only now that it is after ten o’clock are Frodo, Sam, and Pippin shouldering their packs to leave the fir-wood and continue along the narrow forest road toward Woodhall.

‘I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,’ Sam says. All three hobbits hide. Frodo watches a black horse walk into view. Its rider is a stooped figure in a black cloak, who stops to sniff the air before continuing his ride east along the road.

With the stars bright above them, Frodo, Sam, and Pippin sing one of Bilbo’s walking-songs.<br><br>‘Upon the hearth the fire is red<br>Beneath the roof there is a bed<br>But not yet weary are our feet…’<br><br>Just as they finish, they hear hoofbeats approaching from behind. They hide.

Frodo sees the horse’s rider approaching in the dark and almost puts on the Ring, but the man flees. Frodo listens. He hears Elves singing!<br><br>’Snow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear!<br>O Queen beyond the Western Seas!<br>O Light to us that wander here<br>Amid the world of woven trees!’

The Elves greet the three hobbits. ‘I am Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod.’<br><br>Pippin asks the Elves about Black Riders. Gildor doesn’t answer—but does make an exception to the usual Elven custom and lets the hobbits join his company. They walk east together along the road.
