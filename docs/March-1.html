<p>The <em>Tale of Years</em> offers a number of events that belong to this date.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Frodo begins the passage of the Dead Marshes at dawn. Entmoot
continues. Aragorn meets Gandalf the White. They set out for Edoras.
Faramir leaves Minas Tirith on an errand to Ithilien.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>By what time do Frodo, Sam, and Gollum kick off the day’s events
by entering the Dead Marshes?
‘It was already day, a windless and sullen morning’
at the end of the gully when the marshes really begin.
‘After a brief rest they set out again.’
So the time would have been soon after sunrise.</p>

Gollum leads Frodo and Sam out of the ravine and into the Dead Marshes. The morning sky is so overcast and dark that they continue walking without fear yet of being seen.

It’s now morning. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli find hobbit-prints and follow them into Fangorn Forest. They climb up to Treebeard’s ledge to look out from the cliff-top.<br><br>Legolas sees someone moving down in the forest. Gimli sees too—‘There is the old man. All in dirty grey rags.’

<p>
Gimli sees white garments peak out from beneath the old man’s grey rags, and moves to attack—but Legolas cries aloud: ‘Mithrandir!’<br><br>‘Gandalf!’ says Aragorn. ‘Beyond all hope you return to us in our need!’<br><br>The old man pauses. ‘Gandalf. Yes, that was the name. I was Gandalf.’

<p>
After Gandalf and the three hunters have shared their stories, Aragorn stands to his feet. ‘You are our captain and our banner. The Dark Lord has Nine. But we have One, mightier than they: the White Rider. He has passed through the fire and the abyss, and they shall fear him.’

Gandalf emerges from the eaves of Fangorn Forest with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. He issues a piercing whistle. Shadowfax gallops up—and brings with him the two horses that escaped last night. They all ride for Edoras, with Shadowfax leading the way across the boggy fens.

<p>
Scouts report to the Lord Denethor in Minas Tirith that Southron forces are marching north through Ithilien towards the Black Gate. He orders his son Faramir to move forces east to attack.

<p>
After resting through the afternoon and evening, Frodo and Sam follow Gollum deeper into the Dead Marshes. Lights start to swirl around them. ‘The tricksy lights,’ Gollum explains. ‘Candles of corpses.’<br><br>He looks back and sees that only Sam is following him. ‘Where’s the master?’
</p>

<p>
Sam retraces his steps and finds Frodo—who is staring at the lights, hands dripping with slime. Sam leads him forward. ‘Can’t we get on and get away?’<br><br>‘Yes, yes,’ says Gollum. ‘But slowly! Or hobbits go down to join the Dead ones and light little candles. Follow Sméagol!’
