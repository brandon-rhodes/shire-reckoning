<p>The <em>Tale of Years</em> mentions only two story threads for today:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Frodo taken by Faramir to Henneth Annûn. Aragorn comes to Dunharrow
at nightfall.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>And, indeed, the other two threads of the Fellowship’s tale
do seem to lack any milestones on which we could report.
Gandalf and Pippin must be continuing their long ride southeast,
and Merry on his hill-pony must be still trotting into the hills
with King Théoden.</p>
<p>Sam gives the time as ‘nigh on half past eight by Shire clocks, maybe’
when he wakes Frodo to the stew of herbs and rabbits.
It must have been at least a half hour later, and maybe more,
that their breakfast was complete and their smoke drew unwelcome attention.</p>

After walking all night, Sam sends Gollum to find food. He returns with rabbits but is dismayed when Sam cooks them. To the hobbits the small stew of meat and herbs is a feast.<br><br>They are captured when smoke from Sam’s fire attracts Rangers of Ithilien, led by a man named Faramir.

Faramir has two of his Rangers stand guard over Frodo and Sam while the rest ambush a regiment of Southrons moving north along the road to the Black Gate. The remnants of the regiment are pursued and destroyed, but not before Sam gets to see a mighty Oliphant as it careers past.

Aragorn and his companions reach Edoras. After a short rest they set out again, towards Dunharrow where the Paths of the Dead begin.
</p>
</div>
<p>We should place the interrogation at least a couple of hours later,
since we are told that it took place once
‘it was late afternoon and Faramir had come back’.</p>
<!-- TODO Faramir says, "eleven days ago at about this hour of the day, I heard
the blowing of that horn".  Well, drat, how can that be?  Does the sound
of the horn take a long time to travel? -->

The Rangers stand and watch Faramir question Frodo, who learns for the first time that Boromir is dead. Frodo fears the whole Company may have been killed, but Faramir asks: ‘who arrayed Boromir as for a funeral?’<br><br>Faramir decides to take Frodo and Sam with him to Henneth Annûn.

At dusk Aragorn and his Grey Company reach Dunharrow, where they will sleep. When Éowyn cannot dissuade him from his plan to take the Paths of the Dead, she privately asks to come with him. Aragorn refuses: she promised King Théoden she would lead the people until his return.

After dinner Faramir asks more about the hobbits’ journey, about Lothlórien, and about his brother Boromir—leading Sam to exclaim, ‘He wanted the Enemy’s Ring!’<br><br>Faramir smiles. ‘And here in the wild I have you: two halflings, and a host of men at my call, and the Ring of Rings.’

‘Fear not!’ says Faramir. ‘I do not wish to see it, or touch it.’ The hobbits sit back down. Frodo reveals his quest: ‘I must find the Mountain of Fire and cast the thing in…Gandalf said so. I do not think I shall ever get there.’<br><br>Faramir promises his help. The hobbits sleep.
