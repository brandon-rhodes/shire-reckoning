# If Tolkien mistakenly thought that date given by an almanac for the
# "new moon" was the date on which the new crescent actually appeared,
# he could actually have intended the following as the phases of the
# moon in early S.R. 1419:
#
# January 8 - Full
# February 22 - New
# March 8 - Full
# March 21 - New
#
# New and full moons spaced exactly this many days apart do occur
# several times a century.  Here are the dates from 1800 through the
# publication of The Lord of the Rings on which one can place the
# first day of the Shire Year (2 Yule) and get, as a result, the same
# four moon phases as shown above:
