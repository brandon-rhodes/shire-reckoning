Date: 1418 June 20
This was the night that the forces of Sauron attacked Osgiliath.
At the Council of Elrond four months later, on October&nbsp;25th,
Boromir recalls that his men described the Nazgul as
&ldquo;<q>a dark shadow under the moon</q>&rdquo;.

Date: 1418 September 18*
On this night Gandalf was rescued
from his imprisonment atop the pinnacle of Orthanc,
which Frodo dreams of eight nights later
(on the evening of September&nbsp;26th)
at the house of Tom Bombadil.
In his dream he sees &ldquo;<q>the young moon rising</q>&rdquo;,
which presents two problems:
first, that he should instead be seeing an old moon;
and second, that a young moon would be setting rather than rising.
We had better dismiss this observation
as a disorientation produced by the dream.
When he describes the dream at the Council of Elrond a month later,
he only mentions the moonlight falling on Gandalf's hair,
and the wizard,
in his own retelling of the event,
says merely that it was &ldquo;<q>a night of moon</q>&rdquo;.

Date: 1418 September 24
When hiding beside the road from the Black Rider at dusk,
Frodo sees that, &ldquo;<q>Above</q> [the road] <q>the stars
were thick in the dim sky, but there was no moon.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1418 October 4
At their camp the night before reaching the Weather Hills,
the Hobbits and Strider see that,
&ldquo;<q>The moon was waxing, and in the early night-hours
a cold grey light lay on the land.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1418 October 6
Just before their camp on Weathertop is attacked,
the Hobbits see that above Strider
&ldquo;<q>was a black starry sky.
Suddenly a pale light appeared over the crown of Weathertop behind him.
The waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that overshadowed them,
and the stars above the hill-top faded.</q> ...
<q>&lsquo;Look!&rsquo; said Merry.
&lsquo;The Moon is rising: it must be getting late.&rsquo;</q>&rdquo;
They continue to see the Moon on subsequent evenings
as they move south of the Road and make for the Last Bridge.

Date: 1419 January 8
As Aragorn guides the Company of the Ring
through Hollin toward the Redhorn Pass,
the &ldquo;<q>Moon, now at the full, rose over the mountains,
and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black.</q>&rdquo;
Before dawn we are told, consistent with this, that
&ldquo;<q>the moon was low.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1419 January 13
Just before the final attack of the Wargs against the Company,
we are told that the &ldquo;<q>night was old,
and westward the waning moon was setting,
gleaming fitfully through the breaking clouds.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1419 January 14*
Just before the outline of the West Gate of Moria appears on the cliff face,
we are told that the &ldquo;<q>Moon now shone
upon the grey face of the rock</q>&rdquo;,
which can only have happened after midnight &mdash;
and thus early on the&nbsp;14th &mdash;
since a waning moon cannot shine on a westward-facing cliff
until it passes into the western sky after midnight.
So the &ldquo;Tale of Years&rdquo; must be incorrect
when it has the Company enter Moria before midnight on the&nbsp;13th.

Date: 1419 January 15
After the remaining Company emerge from Moria,
Aragorn warns them that they will lack light this evening since
&ldquo;<q>The Moon is almost spent,
and it will be dark tonight</q>&rdquo;,
and indeed when night falls we are told that,
&ldquo;<q>There were many clear stars,
but the fast-waning moon would not be seen till late.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1419 January 16*
In the night, before dawn, Frodo wakes and hears Orcs moving
past the flet on which he is sleeping, and sees that
the &ldquo;<q>sickle Moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves</q>&rdquo;.
This moon should really be exactly half-full, rather than sickle,
eight days after the full moon.

Date: 1419 February 22*
From the camp on the seventh evening after leaving Lorien,
we are told that &ldquo;<q>the white rind of the new Moon could be seen
glimmering in the remote lakes</q>&rdquo;,
raising the problems discussed at length above.

Date: 1419 February 23
On the eighth night from Lorien the &ldquo;<q>thin crescent of the Moon had
fallen early into the pale sunset</q>&rdquo;,
which confuses Sam because he lost track of time in Caras Galadon.

Date: 1419 February 26
As Merry and Pippin were dragged away by the Orcs,
the &ldquo;<q>waxing moon was riding in the West,</q>&rdquo;
and it is described explicitly as &ldquo;<q>the slim moon</q>
 ... <q>already falling westward</q>&rdquo;
and a soon afterwards we are told of
&ldquo;<q>the last rays of the sickle moon.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1419 February 27
As the Three Hunters pursue the Orcs who have captured Merry and Pippin,
we are told that, &ldquo;<q>There in the still cool hour before dawn
they rested for a brief space. The moon had long gone down before them,
the stars glittered above them</q>...&nbsp;<q>.</q>&rdquo;
Late in the day Aragorn decides that,
&ldquo;<q>We will not walk in the dark</q> ... <q>If the Moon gave enough
light, we would use it, but alas! he sets early and is yet
young and pale.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1419 February 28
When the Three Hunters halt again after sunset,
&ldquo;<q>The young moon was glimmering in a misty sky</q>&rdquo;,
and it is described explicitly as a &ldquo;<q>sickle moon.</q>&rdquo;
<p>
Somewhat confusing is the description of this same Moon
when it is sighted by Merry and Pippin
from the Orc-camp that the men of Rohan have surrounded:
&ldquo;<q>Later in the night when the moon
came out of the mist, then occasionally</q> [the Riders] <q>could be
seen, shadowy shapes that glinted now and again in the
white light, as they moved in ceaseless patrol.</q>&rdquo;
This sounds at first reading as though the Moon is rising,
but of course a waxing crescent is always setting after nightfall;
we can only assume that &ldquo;<q>the moon came out of the mist</q>&rdquo;
means actually that the mists
were themselves clearing away from in front of the Moon.
Clouds are given as the reason that the night darkens again later:
&ldquo;<q>It did indeed become very dark again; for the moon passed
westward into thick cloud, and Pippin could not see
anything a few feet away.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1419 February 29
From the cliffs of the Emyn Muil,
Frodo and Sam see the stars appearing &ldquo;<q>like small white holes in the
canopy above the crescent moon.</q>&rdquo;
The Moon is mentioned several more times after they have descended the cliff
and as they encounter Gollum,
and then by the time they set off Sam asserts that
&ldquo;<q>The Moon's gone, and the night's going.</q>&rdquo;
<p>
Faramir says of this date during conversation at Henneth Annun
that he saw the body of Boromir pass him on the Elven-boat
&ldquo;<q>in the grey dark under the young pale moon</q>&rdquo;.

Date: 1419 February 30
When the old man who appears by the campfire
disappears after Aragorn confronts him,
we are told that &ldquo;<q>The moon had set and the night was very dark.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1419 March 1
The moon is visible above Gandalf, Aragorn, and the others
as they ride south towards Edoras:
&ldquo;<q>Under the cold moon they went on once more,
as swift as by the light of day.</q> ... <q>The miles went by. The
waxing moon sank into the cloudy West.</q>&rdquo;
Before dawn Frodo meets Gollum and retains him as a guide,
saying &ldquo;<q>Now for it! The Moon's gone, and the night's going.
We'd better start.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1419 March 2
A Nazgul flies across the Moon
as Frodo, Sam, and Gollum emerge from the Marshes before dawn,
and we are told:
&ldquo;<q>It was not until the moon
had sunk, westering far beyond Tol Brandir, that</q> [Gollum] <q>would
get up or make a move.</q>&rdquo;
At the end of the day
the Riders of Rohan make camp on their way to battle
with the forces of Saruman,
and &ldquo;<q>In a great circle, under the starry sky and the waxing moon,
they now made their bivouac.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1419 March 3
After driving Orcs from the doors of the fortress in the early night,
Eomer and Aragorn halt before the gates and see
&ldquo;<q>The clouds were torn and drifting, and stars peeped out;
and above the hills of the Coomb-side the westering moon
rode, glimmering yellow in the storm-wrack.</q>&rdquo;
Later, when Gimli announces that he killed two orcs,
&ldquo;<q>The sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was
shining brightly. But the light brought little hope to the
Riders of the Mark.</q>&rdquo;
Finally, &ldquo;<q>Aragorn looked at the pale stars, and at the moon, now
sloping behind the western hills that enclosed the valley.</q>&rdquo;
<p>
And when later recounting the destruction of Isengard by the Ents,
Pippin remembers the same westerning moon:
&ldquo;<q>&lsquo;It must have been about midnight when the Ents broke the
dams and poured all the gathered waters through a gap in
the northern wall, down into Isengard. The Huorn-dark had
passed, and the thunder had rolled away. The Moon was
sinking behind the western mountains.&rsquo;</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1419 March 4
Above Gandalf as he leads King Theoden towards Isengard,
&ldquo;<q>The slow moon mounted, now waxing towards the full,
and in its cold silver light the swelling grass-lands
rose and fell like a wide grey sea.</q>&rdquo;
The wolves scavenging at the Fords slink away when they see
&ldquo;<q>Gandalf in the moon, and Shadowfax his horse shining like silver.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1419 March 5
Hours before dawn, as they approach Isengard, we are told that
&ldquo;<q>Dark lay the vale before them,
for the moon had passed into the West, and its light was hidden by the hills.</q>&rdquo;
Even later &ldquo;<q>the watchmen cried out, and all awoke. The moon was gone.</q>&rdquo;
<p>
The Moon appears again that evening after dark
as they are returning southward from Isengard:
&ldquo;<q>Night came down from the mountains. All the mists were
gone. A chill wind blew. The moon, now waxing round,
filled the eastern sky with a pale cold sheen.</q>&rdquo;
A few more references are made to the Moon,
adding no further information,
as Pippin steals and looks into the Palantir
and then as a Nazgul passes across the Moon's face.
<p>
From the point of view of Frodo and Sam and Gollum,
&ldquo;<q>The moon was now three nights from the full, but it did not
climb over the mountains until nearly midnight, and the
early night was very dark.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1419 March 6
Before dawn Aragorn as he is overtaken by the Dunedain sees
&ldquo;<q>The sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud</q>&rdquo;.
In the evening,
Frodo etc see &ldquo;<q>The night became fine under star and round moon</q>&rdquo;.

Date: 1419 March 7
As Pippin rides east with Gandalf on Shadowfax,
we are told that on &ldquo;<q>the third night since he had looked in the stone</q>&rdquo;
he saw &ldquo;<q>the moon rising above the eastern shadows,
now almost at the full.</q>&rdquo;
This raises the difficulty that the <i>third night</i>
could refer either to the evening of the 7th or the 8th,
depending on how one counted;
but fortunately the ambiguity is resolved a few paragraphs later
when Pippin wonders where Frodo is
and we are told that Frodo was looking on
&ldquo;<q>that same moon as it set beyond Gondor ere the coming of the day.</q>&rdquo;
This means that we correctly place this observation
such that the following morning Frodo is seeing the full moon set
from Henneth Annun.

Date: 1419 March 8
When Faramir wakes Frodo he says &ldquo;<q>the full moon is setting</q>&rdquo;,
and when the Hobbits go outside they indeed see
that &ldquo;<q>in the West the full moon was sinking, round and white.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1419 March 9
When in the evening Theoden reaches Dunharrow,
he tells Eomer that &ldquo;<q>Last night the moon was full, and in the
morning I shall ride to Edoras to the gathering of the Mark.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1419 March 10
In the morning before dawn,
as Gollum leads Frodo and Sam westward towards the crossroads,
&ldquo;<q>the sinking moon escaped from the pursuing cloud</q>&rdquo;.

Date: 1419 March 24
As the armies of the West spend the night encamped
in the desolate plain before the Black Gate of Mordor,
we are told that &ldquo;<q>the
waxing moon was four nights old, there were smokes and
fumes that rose out of the earth and the white crescent
was shrouded in the mists of Mordor.</q>&rdquo;

Date: 1419 April 8
As Frodo and Sam relax in the evening
after being honored on the Field of Cormallen,
&ldquo;<q>the round Moon rode slowly above the mists of Anduin and
flickered through the fluttering leaves</q>&rdquo;.

Date: 1421 September 22*
As Frodo and Sam ride through the Shire at night
with Elrond, Galadriel, and the other High-Elves who are leaving Middle-earth,
the text tells us that &ldquo;<q>the Moon went westward</q>&rdquo; above them.
In fact, it seems that no moon should have been visible.
